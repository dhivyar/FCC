# FCC Net Neutrality Repeal :: Comment Scoring

The repo consists of four files for the FCC Net Neutrality Repeal Comment Scoring Project:

1. FCC_NetNeutrality.Rmd- The R Markdown code
2. FCC_NetNeutrality.html- The analyses, approach and plots knitted in a HTML noteBook rendered in this link: http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dhivyar/FCC/blob/master/FCC_NetNeutrality.html
3. Plot1.png- This plot shows four comment campaigns where the exact comments with the exact wordings were repeated in 170697, 37393, 2544 and 31254 comments resp.
4. Plot2.png- Using the Startup Policy Lab estimates to identify the target variable: Fake (0/1), we compare the Fake rate for pro repeal and against repeal comments.
